# Sokatoa

For my **Portfolio Project 2** on **Code Institute's 5 Project Course** I have created this fun and informational website focused on teaching student's some foundational trigonometic principles. The site includes useful notes and quizes to reinforce the student's learning

- Ensure site users remember the different functions after they leave the site.
<br>

## User Experience

### Target Audience
- Those learning the basics of trigonometry
- Those studying for junior cycle maths exams.
- People looking for a simple way to memorise the trig functions.
<br>

### User Requirements and Expectations

## Design

### Design Choice
This webpage has been designed to be visually interesting and provide the readers the information required for them to feel confident in their understanding of trigonometric functions.
<br>

### Colour Palette
The chosen colour palette was picked to be simple to emphasise the content with more vibrant colours to indicate incorrect and correct answers in the quiz.
<br>
<figure>
    <img src="assets/docs/features/colour-palette.png" alt="The colour palette used for the website">
    <figcaption>The colour palette used for the website</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

### Fonts
The *Noto Sans* font was used for headings and text body.
<br>

### Structure

<br>
The site is constructed to be as user-friendly as possible. Upon arriving on the site the user is given a brief introduction to the site and its purpose before the user navigates to the next page. The site is spread across 4 seperate sections on a single html page:

- On the index.html page:
    - A landing and introductory section.
    - one section where to user can learn basic trigonometry.
    - one secion with a quiz.
    - one section with the quiz results.
- A contact form.
- A 404 page.

<details><summary>Fixes after local testing.</summary>

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| During the quiz differing image sizes can cause the option buttons to jump around | A fix likely unworthwhile as jumping only occurs when width is smaller than any known devices |
