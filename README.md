# Sokatoa

For my **Portfolio Project 2** on **Code Institute's 5 Project Course** I have created this fun and informational website focused on teaching student's some foundational trigonometic principles. The site includes useful notes and quizes to reinforce the student's learning

<br>
The site is constructed to be very user-friendly. Upon arriving on the site the user is asked what activity they would like to do. The site is spread across three seperate pages:

- A home-page with four diffent views:
    - A menu to choose the activity.
    - one page where to user can learn.
    - one page with a quiz.
    - one page with the quiz results.
- A contact form.
- A 404 page.

### Version Control
#### Git and Github
Repository created on Github. 
Method:
- Create new public repository on Gitpod using the CodeInstitiute template.
- Open a Gitpod workspace.
- Create required folders and documents.
- Project was previewed using the liveserver port on a the Firefox browser.
- Work was continuosly saved and committed using the following git commands:
    - **git add .** to stage changes to git.
